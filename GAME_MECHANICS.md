# 🎮 StrideRealm Game Mechanics Guide

Welcome to the **StrideRealm** core mechanics guide. This document explains the primary features that drive your conquest and progression through the city.

## 🔝 1. Level System (`Lvl`)

Your **Level** represents your rank and experience as a Commander in the Realm.

*   **How it works**: Progression is driven by **XP (Experience Points)**.
*   **Gaining XP**: You earn XP primarily by capturing territories. The larger the area you capture, the more XP you receive.
*   **Formula**: Every **1,000 XP** earns you a new level.
    *   *Example*: 2,500 XP = Level 3.
*   **Rewards**: Higher levels increase your prestige on the **National Leaderboard** and demonstrate your dominance over your city.

## ⚡ 2. Energy System (`%`)

**Energy** is your most valuable resource. Think of it as your "Stamina" for capturing the world.

*   **Consumption**: When you are in **Capture Mode** (tracing a path), your energy drains steadily.
*   **Regeneration**: To recharge, you must move around the city *without* capturing. 
    *   Walking or running in "passive mode" slowly restores your energy.
*   **Strategic Limits**:
    *   **Minimum Start**: You need at least **10% Energy** to begin a new capture.
    *   **Force Stop**: If your energy hits **0%** while you are tracing a loop, the capture will fail and your path will be reset.
*   **Pro Tip**: Plan your routes! Don't start a massive multi-kilometer loop if your energy is low.

## 👥 3. Active Presence (`People`)

The "People" counter in your header shows the **Real-Time Presence** of other players in the game.

*   **Multiplayer Sync**: RunRealm is a shared world. The number next to the people icon tells you how many other commanders are currently active in your region.
*   **Live Map**: You can see the trails and pulse-pointers of other players on your map if they are nearby.
*   **Competition**: If the number of people is high, it means your city is a "Hot Zone" for activity. Watch out—other players might be trying to capture the same streets as you!
